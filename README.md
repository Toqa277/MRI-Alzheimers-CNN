# MRI-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Stages Using 3D, 2D, and Transfer Learning Convolution Neural Networks Models
This project aims to classify Alzheimer's Stages Using 3D, 2D, and Transfer Learning CNN Models. Using the ADNI dataset (32,559 MRI scans), it classifies AD stages (CN, MCI, AD) with workflows for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation via accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrices.
