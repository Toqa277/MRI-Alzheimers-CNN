# MRI-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease Stages Using 3D, 2D, and Transfer Learning Convolution Neural Networks Models
This project aims to classify Alzheimer's Stages Using 3D, 2D, and Transfer Learning CNN Models. Using the ADNI dataset (32,559 MRI scans), it classifies AD stages (CN, MCI, AD) with workflows for data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation via accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrices.

The ADNI1 is a public-private collaboration supported by organizations such as the National Institute on Aging, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, the
 Alzheimer's Association, and several companies. This dataset includes advanced imaging techniques such as MRI. With 5,409 participants at various cognitive stages,
 it is one of the largest datasets available for Alzheimer's research. It includes 32,559 original MRI scans that areclassed as follows: 6,584 photos from AD patients,
 20,025 photos from MCI subjects, and 11,046 photos from CN participants
